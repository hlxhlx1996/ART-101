            <p> PHOTOGRAPHY &nbsp TECHNIQUES!</p>
            <br>
            <p> First, you will need to find a background clean enough to place your project. It does not need to be completely white, but you have to make sure that the background would not be too attractive to attract viewer's eyes. Otherwise, the project needs to be big and focused enough to blur the background out. This would require a more professional camera. After you got a great photo with great organization, the rest can be dealt with photoshop. The picture on the left is one of the hair decorations I made using resin. You may have noticed that the hair decoration seems unnaturally glowing. This is because I added a filter on the photo such that the color looks purple rather than the orignial red. All kinds of filters or color modifications can be used in order to achieve the effect you want!</p>

            <p> Though I have spoiled earlier that I will not be introducing any other new crafting materials but combinations and interesting projects, I think it would be also interesting to share my experience in cooking as well. Therefore, I will share my recent inspiration on cooking!</p>
            <br>
            <p> SAUSAGE &nbsp PASTA!</p>
            <br>
            <p> I got the inspiration of making sausage pasta from a popular post on twitter I saw several months ago. Everybody knows that pasta is great with sausages, but are usually having a hard time deciding whether to eat sausage first or pasta first, similar to the typical question of eating strawberry first or cake first for a strawberry cake. So this method is there to solve the problem! Since each noodle has a piece of sausage attached to it, it is sure that you can always get a bite of sausage while eating pasta! The pancake containing the pasta comes from a cooking animation called "Shokugeki no Soma". There is an episode about wrapping fried chicken with lettuce and pancake. I got the idea from that episode and wrap the sausage pasta with lettuce and pancake, and is shockingly tasty!</p>

            <p> Previously, I have introduced yarn as a material for crafting. Knitting and crochetting are two basic techniques that are used while manipulating yarn. Sweaters, hats, gloves and blankets are the most common projects that can be made with either knitting or crochetting. So for this blog, I will show you one of the best project I have made recently using crochet.</p>
            <br>
            <p> GLOVES! </p>
            <br>
            <p> The picture on the left is a pair of gloves I made for the upcomming winter. I used different colors of yarn in the body of the gloves so that it wouldn't look too boring with only one color. After I made the main portion of the gloves, I added two pieces of eyes on each glove and attached them with yarn as well. Since I do not have the experience of making gloves with finger covers, I decided to make fingerless gloves in the end so that I wouldn't have to deal with the finger parts. The result came out to be pretty good since those eyes looks more realistic without fingers.</p>

            <p> As I have mentioned in my previous blog, I will not introduce new materials for crafting any more since I pretty much ran out of the materials I have tried myself. For this blog and the later on ones, I will still introduce something I made by myself but will be either the combinations of different materials I have introduced earlier, or just something I feel that looks really great. For today's blog, I will introduce the combination:</p>
            <br>
            <p> RESIN & CLAY! </p>
            <br>
            <p> The one I made in the picture is just simple resin rings with transparent color added to them. The only variation is that I stuffed the rings with tiny fruit slices made out of clay. Although the fruit slices are not made by myself, this idea really gives great results. I planned to make a series of rings of this kind and color the rings with colors similar to the fruit slices I use, red for strawberries, yellow for lemmons, orange for oranges etc. The combinations of resin and clay can make two materials looking dull by itself into a combination that looks intriquing!</p>

            <p> This is perhaps the last crafting material I will introduce in this series of crafting material introductions. Material for this week is actually inspired by the craft project I did in the picture of last week. As a person who really loves tiny decorations, such as ear studs, earrings, and rings, I have made a lot of tiny jewlery for myself. (well, fake jewlery made of resin, of course) So I will introduce one of the most useful material for making jewlery!</p>
            <br>
            <p> WIRES! </p>
            <br>
            <p> The picture I posted is the basic wire rings I made recently. Since I am still a beginner in wrapping wires, I have not tried to put resin projects on the rings yet. Later I will probably try to combine the two materials together and see the outcome. Although I did not manage to apply resin projects into the wire projects, I tried to apply nail polish on the wired rings I made. As one of the rings in the picture, the one with cat ears is one of the best projects I have made by applying nail polish on my rings. I simply just made a pure wired ring with two cat ears, and then I applied my nail polish to fill the wholes of those cat ears. Since the nail polish I chose has sparkles in it, the result turned out to be really impressive especially when I shoot them under sunlight! I have also tried to apply pure colored nail polish on my other wired rings as well, but that did not turn out to be pretty though. But still the procedure of exploring different materials and combining them is really satisfying.</p>

            <p> For this week, the material is even more abstract. While clay remains solid before and after it has been used for a crafting project, material for this week is still liquid when it was still a raw material. Material for this week is: </p>
            <br>
            <p> RESIN! </p>
            <br>
            <p> Initially, resin is used as an industrial material. Since it remains liquid until it has been mixed, and the final finish has great strength, it is often used to fix minor flaws of infrastructure. Although it has been called resin for the entire group, there are many kinds of resin for distinct uses. The one I used in the picture is the most common one: clear resin. The resin is transparent when there is no color added to it so the designers get to decide its finish. This kind of resin has two seperate portion and the user needes to pour a specific ratio of the two portions in order to let the resin dry properly. After mixing the two portions, adding colors, or other tiny stuff into the resin and pour them into the mold you wanted, it needes at least 24 hours to dry. Another kind of resin is called: UV resin. Instead of having to measure the amount of two portions of the resin, UV resin comes with only one bottle and is usually sold in different colors, either tranparent or opaque. UV resin won't dry in air, but will instead dry with UV light. UV resin is usually capable of making tiny crafts while the basic resin is used for larger crafts.</p>

            <p> As I have already introduced several crafting materials, you may probably noticed that the materials are getting more and more abstract, which need more and more imaginations as well in order to make a great craft. Material for this week is even more abstract! While yarns will at least remain the texture after finishing the projects, material for this week is not even going to remain the original shape and even feel. Material for this week is: </p>
            <br>
            <p> CLAY!</p>
            <br>
            <p> There are four main types of clay that are mostly used for crafts, polymer clay, paper clay, airweight clay and bubber clay. For beginners, bubber clay is mostly used, since it won't dry for a long period of time. That is why it is also used for children. Airweight clay and paper clay both dries after putting them outside for a couple of hours. Airweight clay has smooth texture and vivid color, while paper clay has rigid texture and mostly white. Paper clay is mostly used for statue projects that may need rigid finish. For airweight clay, since it will alter its size a little after dried, it wont be suitable for detailed projects. This is where polymer clay comes into place. Polymer clay wont dry with air, but heat. Popular methods are baking or heat gun. The picture I showed on the left is two tiny polymer clay projects. You can see that the details can be better showed with polymer clay since it wont alter its size after drying and you can take your time to stick to the details since it wont dry before you bake it.</p>

            <p> After spending four weeks to introduce blocks as materials of a craft, this week I will introduce a brand new material that requires even more technics and imagination.</p>
            <br>
            <p> YARNs! </p>
            <br>
            <p> There are two main types of techniques using yarns, knitting and crochet. For this week, I will introduce crochet. Unlike knitting, which is used mostly for sweathers, crochet can do more decorating crafts, such as dolls and blankets. It is fascinating to see how a ball of yarn can be turned into a doll! The picture shows a tiny doll I made with yarns using basic crochet technique. This type of crafts is called "Amigurumi", which is derived from Japanese meaning crocheting dolls. Although it may look pretty hard for someone who does not know how to knit, it is actually pretty simple and easy to catch up. While there may be a whole lot of different patterns of stiches, doing amigurumis only need one of them, the very basic single crochet. Variations only exits in amigurumi projects when there may be special decorations such as ears and teeth, or the technique on finishing the project. It spent me only one week to individually crochet a ball and finish a tiny bear, given that I dont have any knitting experience at all!</p>

            <p> Topic for this week is another branch of block building. While blocks such as LEGOs or fusing beads differ only a little among all kinds of blocks, this material consists of completely different blocks so that the project can be more varied. The picture on the left is one project I made with this material. Unfortunately, I cannot remember the name of the brand and it has been a while after I built this. I followed the pattern from the product to build the arrow gun. The gun was so well-designed that I can actually use it to shoot with foam bullet. Then I removed the arrow part of the gun to make it more like a normal gun. Though I have not tried much with this material, this is another material that is worth trying!</p>

            <p> Since I have started to make fusing beads since I was freshman, and now I am a senior, I am really experienced with this material. Therefore I feel like I should spend two blogs to write about fusing beads. While I only made 2D projects when I first started this material. I soon got the idea that I can make 3D ones according to many fusing-beads project pictures. While the beads can only be fused as a board, you can always make three dimensional ones by making seperate parts to form a huge project.</p>
            <br>
            <p> The picture on the left is a puppy I made as one of my first three dimensional projects. There are two ways of building a three dimensional projects. One is to make separate parts and glue them together, as the one I did for the puppy. The other approach is to integrate separate parts as how you build LEGO blocks. For this approach, you need to plan ahead and get a better idea of how the project should look like in all aspects. I sometimes failed to make one successfully because of some missing beads. But still, this approach is really intriguing and requires lots of imagination.</p>

            <p> For this week's blog, I will talk about something similar to LEGOs. This material also lets you to build blocks by yourself and realize your imagination. It is called:</p>
            <br>
            <p> FUSING BEADS!</p>
            <br>
            <p> Unlike LEGOs, fusing beads are not reusable. Once you get your project finished, you cannot get them back to beads again. The basic machanism in building projects with fusing beads is that you place your beads on a building board. When you are satisfied with your work, you need to put a paper above the beads and use an iron to heat the beads until both sides of them fused and merged into an entire board. The picture on the left is one project I did when I was just a beginner. Initially I planned to make a claw as a representation of nittany lion, but I did not get any blue beads in the starter kit. So I switched to make a pink one instead and put it on the wall. Even now I have several fusing beads project I made on my refrigerator! It is really satisfying to make everything you want with fusing beads, especially when you like anime.

I have also thought about writing about Asian traditions, animes, or games. Well, they attract me as well for sure, but as I am currently obsessed with making crafts, I decided to write about all the materials I have tried to make crafts.</p>

I have a collection of various colorful blocks with regular size and miniature size as well. The photo is a LEGO product that I made with miniature size. Though I love the procedure and the accomplishment that is provided by built-in LEGO kits that requires me to follow the manual to build, I love those LEGO kits better without any manuals at all. I get to create anything in my mind, animals, anime figures, buildings, and many more.</p>
